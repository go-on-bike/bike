# Welcome to bike

## What's Bike
Bike is an application framework that consists of a collection of options and tools to create a simplified [hexagonal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_architecture_(software)) and idiomatic Go application.

Bike aims to give developers a sense of freedom, focus and speed, just as a real bike.

> [!NOTE]  
> You can use bike to build any application, not just web.

> [!NOTE]
> Bike is in pre alpha state of development. expect a lot of changess. 

## Why bike?

I just happend to love bikes and when I was thinking how to name my framework I tought of a bike.
Riding my bike makes me feel the same way I feel when I'm programming, it's the flow state of mind when you are feeling the present moment. 

To achieve that feeling I believe that we, as developers, have to create our own set of reusable tools that makes sense to whoever built it, to let teams of different developers go crazy on the code safely without thinking about databases, sockets, ports, connetions, etc. just worry about the business logic, that's where the fun of programming is. 

This framework let's the developer just worry about the application layer if they want.

It has many optios and of course if the developer want to use some of their tools they can. 

## Contributing

If you build a tool, testing tool or adapter, feel free to share it with us.

> [!NOTE]
> Everything has to be tested some way or another. every code that's gets incorporated has to come with tests.
